Objective:
- Given a trace log file tracking superpage creations, identify how often a virtual address region
    fails/succeeds in being promoted to a superpage.
Input:
- ktr.out.txt: A trace file of which the 2+ lines log, in order, memory operations. Each line follows a format of:
    
[index of the operationâ€™s execution] [operation]: [optional details] pmap [hex address of physical memory mapping]
    
- There are four operations: pmap_remove_pages, pmap_promote_pde, pmap_enter_pde, pmap_demote_pde.
- [optional details] only applies to pmap_promote_pde, pmap_enter_pde, pmap_demote_pde. Listed are 
    the formats for [optional details]:
    - pmap_enter_pde: success for va [hex virtual address] in
    - pmap_demote_pde: [success/failure] for va [hex virtual address] in
    - pmap_promote_pde: [success/failure/protect] for va [hex virtual address] in

Output:
- A log keeping track, for each superpage virtual address region, the number of times protection
    was added, a superpage was promoted, or a superpage was entered. The log also notes when a 
    superpage promotion failed or succeeded.

Special Edge Conditions:
- 

Examples:
    - We failed to promote 7 times, and then succeeded.
    - 1254-1256, there was protect, fail and ultimately succeed
    - This is the page we removed, which is part of a larger superpage that we failed 6x and succeeded.
    - We have 25 regions we failed no times before succeeded.
    - No times before succeeded, multiple times before succeeded, multiple times before failed to promote
    - Promote and then demote and then repromoted
