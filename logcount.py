Objective:
- Given a trace log file tracking superpage creations, identify how often a virtual address region
    fails in being promoted/entered to a superpage before success, if any.
- Count the total amount of demotions logged.
- Count the number of protections that did/didn't lead to promotion before pmap_remove_pages is called.

Input:
- ktr.out.txt: A trace file of which the 2+ lines log, in order, memory operations. Each line follows a format of:
    
[index of the operationâ€™s execution] [operation]: [optional details] pmap [hex address of physical memory mapping]
    
- There are four operations: pmap_remove_pages, pmap_promote_pde, pmap_enter_pde, pmap_demote_pde.
- [optional details] only applies to pmap_promote_pde, pmap_enter_pde, pmap_demote_pde. Listed are 
    the formats for [optional details]:
    - pmap_enter_pde: success for va [hex virtual address] in
    - pmap_demote_pde: [success/failure] for va [hex virtual address] in
    - pmap_promote_pde: [success/failure/protect] for va [hex virtual address] in

- Examples of inputs:
    27 pmap_remove_pages: pmap 0xfffffe0185998540
    28 pmap_promote_pde: success for va 0x3c8000 in pmap 0xfffffe0185998540
   940 pmap_promote_pde: failure for va 0x80a1cd000 in pmap 0xfffffe018598cd60
  1058 pmap_promote_pde: protect for va 0x80946e000 in pmap 0xfffffe018598cd60
  1274 pmap_enter_pde: success for va 0x200000 in pmap 0xfffffe010cfeb788
  1202 pmap_demote_pde: success for va 0x808098000 in pmap 0xfffffe010cfeb788
394596 pmap_demote_pde: failure for va 0x8101ff000 in pmap 0xfffffe01a4752170

Output:
- A log counting the number of times a superpage VA region failed 0 times before promotion,
  failed 1 time before promotion, etc. Also, counting how often promotion failures occur before
  a superpage entering occurs ie 0 failures before entering, 1 failure before entering, etc. 
  Also, failed 0 times before pmap removal (without promotion),
  failed 1 time before pmap removal (without promotion), etc.
